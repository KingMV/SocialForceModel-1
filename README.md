Social Force Model - Python library for pedestrian dynamics
===========================================================

Solves for the dynamics of pedestrians using a so-called "social force
model" based on the article [Helbing & Molnar Phys. Rev. E 51, 4282 (1995)]

- Includes .

Installation
============

Requirements:

- Git
- Python and Numpy, Scipy dependencies

The following instructions are for a Unix-like environment without 
root privileges.

In a terminal,

```sh
mkdir SocialForceModel
cd SocialForceModel
git clone https://github.com/UCLGuichard/SocialForceModel
```

This gets the code. Now let's run it.

```sh
cd SocialForceModel/src
python SocialForceModel.py
```

If all went well, you should now have a test case running.

***SocialForceModel has been developed and tested under Windows and Eclipse IDE with Python 2.7 Interpreter and Anaconda***
